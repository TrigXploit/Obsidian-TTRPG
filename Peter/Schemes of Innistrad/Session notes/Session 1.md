## start

Days


After killing Willhelt (a necromancer who was creating a lot of zombies in the back allys), we talked about what we shoould do.

We decide to have a short rest, where we find a house without traps.
in the living room there are clawmarks,
Ray walks upstairs, and open up the door.
there is a rat and ray uses "speak with animals" and starts talking with the rat who was in the room.


Vi g√• ind i et lukket rum og finder et smykke sejl fra Saint Traft.
