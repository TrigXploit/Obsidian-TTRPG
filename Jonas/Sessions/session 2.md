We found out that Duke Horaceo spent his money on the cathedral instead of  the guards.


We go to the bridge and clear out the goblins in all of the houses / stalls. we do see a random guy waving at us while doing this.

I get to do a bit of harvesting on 2 goblins and on a mimic. 
We go back and talk with the duke who is surprised that a mimic is there.


the children are annoying the people in the church listening to the sermin while Ziigy said "im not allowed in churches since she has blown up a few".

While Fenra helps clear the church and goblins.
