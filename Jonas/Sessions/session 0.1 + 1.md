A Rumor from Duke Horaceo that a "problem" has popped up and my uncle sent me to fix it.

its somewhat urgent but the request came with no details.

I met the other characters, a small girl who seems like she likes gunpowder too much and a small mycelian girl who seems to just have woken up.

I met Duke Horaceo in Lumbridge castle, along with the 2 girls who i met on the  way there, apparently they are also there. The request is to slay some goblins before the Dukes brother arrives for a feast.

The reason goblins are a problem is due to some bad spending on the dukes part.
