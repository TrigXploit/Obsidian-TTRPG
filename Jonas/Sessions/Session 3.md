We are woken up the middle of the night to find out that the Priest (the on Ziigy & Aelen talked with) has been stabbed. The Maester (incence master) has been killed

we get there and see he is being Healed, he tells us that his disciple was the one who stabbed him. Aelen feels undead comming from the basement of the cathedral.
