##### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords  
**Tools:** Thieves' tools  
**Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Intelligence  
**Skills:** Choose **four** from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth

##### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- (a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword
- (a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword
- (a) a burglar's pack, (b) dungeoneer's pack, or (c) an explorer's pack
- Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves' tools

## Level 1
### Expertise
At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

### Sneak Attack
Once per turn, you can deal an extra **1d6 damage** to one creature you hit with an attack **if you have advantage on the attack roll**. The attack **must use a finesse or a ranged weapon**.

**You don't need advantage on the attack roll if** :
another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.


### Thieves' Cant
You learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. 
It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

## Level 2
### Cunning Action
You can take a **bonus action** on each of your turns to take the **Dash, Disengage, or Hide** action.

## Level 3
### Roguish Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Steady Aim (Optional)
As a **bonus action**, you give yourself **advantage** on your next **attack** roll on the **current turn**.
You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

## Level 4
### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.


## Level 5
### Uncanny Dodge
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.


## Level 6
### Expertise
At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.


## Level 7
### Evasion
Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an [Ice Storm](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ice-storm) spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
