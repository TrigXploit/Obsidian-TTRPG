### Bonus Proficiencies | 1st-level Hunt Domain
You gain proficiency with two martial weapons of your choice. 
You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: 
- Animal Handling
- Nature
- Survival.

### Domain Spells | 1st-level Hunt Domain
You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in
the Hunt Domain Spells table.


### Mark Prey | 1st-level Hunt Domain feature
As a **bonus action**, you choose a creature you can see within **90 feet**, mark it as your target for the next hour. While marked you deal an extra **1d6 damage** to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have **advantage** on any **Perception and Survival checks you make to find it**. If you mark a new creature, any previous marks disappear.


### Channel Divinity: Honed Instincts | 2nd-level Hunt Domain
You can use your Channel Divinity to gain preternatural insights into one creature you can see within 120 feet of you (no action required). 
Choose one of the following lists of information to learn about the target:
- **Proficiencies**. You learn the saving throws and skills with which the creature is proficient.
- **Physiology**. You learn the creature’s 
	- damage resistances, 
	- immunities,
	- vulnerabilities,
	- condition immunities.

In addition, the next time you hit the target with a weapon attack within the next minute, 
you deal the attack’s maximum damage instead of rolling.


### Pack Hunter | 6th-level Hunt Domain feature
You learn to work with other hunters, helping them avoid your quarry’s blows, or to strike with greater ferocity. 

As a reaction, you can embolden creatures friendly to you with your hunters’ instincts, issuing either the Kill or Retreat command. 
You have a number of uses of this feature equal to your Wisdom modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a **short or long rest**.

- **Kill**. When a creature other than you hits a target which is currently affected by your Mark Prey feature, 
  you can use your reaction to deal the feature’s extra damage to the creature.

- **Retreat**. When the target of your Mark Prey feature targets a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to embolden the creature being attacked. The attacked creature can choose to use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks immediately before the attack occurs, potentially causing the attack to miss if the creature moves out of the attackers reach/range.


### Unflinching Mark | 8th-level Hunt Domain feature
The bonus damage of your Mark Prey feature
increases to 2d6. 


### Unflinching Mark II | 14th-level Hunt Domain feature
The bonus damage of your Mark Prey feature
increases to 3d6


### Rite of the Hunt

At 17th level, you can compel a creature to chase
or avoid you. As a bonus action while you can see
the target of your Mark Prey feature and it is within
120 feet of you, you can force the creature to make a
Wisdom saving throw against your cleric spell save
DC. On a failure, you choose whether the creature
is afflicted by Chase or Avoid for the next **minute**.
The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end
of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
These effects are suppressed while you can’t see the
creature, and the effects end early if the creature
is no longer affected by your Mark Prey feature. A
creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this
ability is immune to its effects for the next 24 hours.
- Chase. The creature is drawn to you. For the
duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls
against creatures other than you, and must
make a Wisdom saving throw the first time it
attempts to move to a space that is more than
30 feet away from you on its turn. On a failed
save, it can’t move more than 30 feet away from
you that turn. On a success, this effect doesn’t
restrict the target’s movement for that turn.
- Avoid. The creature is repelled by you. For the
duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls
against you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw the first time it attempts to move to
a space within 30 feet of you on its turn. On
a failed save, it can’t willingly move closer to
you that turn. On a success, this effect doesn’t
restrict the target’s movement for that turn.
